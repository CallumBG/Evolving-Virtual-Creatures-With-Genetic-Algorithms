# Evolving-Virtual-Creatures-With-Genetic-Algorithms

A university project that has since been improved upon, the idea is to use an artificial intelligence algorithm, a genetic algorithm in this case, to create creatures that are adapated to their environment, in this case we are selecting for ability to move in their environment.

Creatures are initially created, with a randomly sized body and limbs which attach in a random direction as shown:

These are simulated for 20seconds in their virtual environment:

Then a function is used to select 2 "parent" creatures based on their performance.

These are used to make the next generation of creatures, along with mutation this allows for the creatures performance to improve over time.

Here is an example of 200 generations being simulated:

These are some examples of motions the creatures developed to effectively move in their environment:

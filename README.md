# Evolving-Virtual-Creatures-With-Genetic-Algorithms

A university project that has since been improved upon, the idea is to use an artificial intelligence algorithm, a genetic algorithm in this case, to create creatures that are adapated to their environment, in this case we are selecting for ability to move in their environment.

Creatures are initially created, with a randomly sized body and limbs which attach at a random place in a random direction, here is an example:

These are simulated for 20seconds in their virtual environment:

Then a function is used to select 2 "parent" creatures based on their performance.

These are used to make the next generation of creatures, along with mutation this allows for the creatures performance to improve over time.

Here is a 10x speed example of 20 generations being simulated:

Here is a 10x speed example of the same simulation after 150 generations, as you can see the creatures have evolved to move much further:

These are some examples of motions the creatures developed to effectively move in their environment:
